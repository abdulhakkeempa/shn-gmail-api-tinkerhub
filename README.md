## OTP Generator using Gmail API
We have used Python Django as backend and integrated with Gmail API to create a simple OTP Generator
1. The main page prompts user to enter the his/her email id
2. One Time Password (OTP) will be sent to the user's given mail id
3. User has to input the OTP and the server validates whether it is correct or not.
